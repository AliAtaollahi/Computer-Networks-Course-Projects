# Computer-Networks-Course-Projects
Projects of Computer Networks course in University of Tehran; Spring 2023

CA1 Description :
> Homework for socket programming assignments in C and C++.
This assignment about Hotel Management System. This system offers a number of choices, like reserving a room, reviewing customer information, changing or removing any client, and seeing all rooms that have been assigned. 

CA2 Description :
> In this assignment, you'll simulate a wireless network with the ns-3 simulation tool. This network implements a simple cryptography algorithm that maps numbers to English letters. Furthermore, you should calculate and analyze some network metrics to see its performance.

CA3 Description :
> The aim of this exercise is to become more familiar with network routing algorithms. In this exercise, we will implement and compare Border Gateway, distance vector and link state, using C++.

CA4 Description :
> In this exercise, we aim to implement three congestion control algorithms for TCP; TCP is a transport layer protocol widely used and its important characteristic is the ability to establish reliable communication. The purpose of this exercise is to gain a deeper understanding of how TCP communication is established and the various mechanisms employed by congestion control algorithms when encountering congestion.
Also, you will focus on implementing and analyzing three congestion control algorithms: Reno, New Reno, and BBR.
